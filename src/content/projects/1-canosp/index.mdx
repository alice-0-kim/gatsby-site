The Department of Computer Science at UBC offers a directed study opportunity in collaboration with <b>CANOSP</b>.
I worked on <b>Predictive Text Studio</b> which is a simple web-based interface for creating dictionaries to provide predictive text and autocorrect facilities on smartphones for less-resourced languages, along with two other passionate individuals mentored by <b>Eddie Antonio</b>.
