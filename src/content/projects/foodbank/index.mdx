One common hurdle for food banks is the lack of consistent donations &ndash; there is usually a rush of donations around the holiday seasons which tapers off quickly. Our goal is to gamify the process and "level up" users as they donate, so that it will incentivise consistent donations. We built a mobile app for active donors to check for the inventory status at a local food bank.
